#<b>Technical Test - Create Validated Form.#</b>

##<b>BRIEF/BACKGOUND PROJECT</b>##

This is a technical test I took as part of the recruiment process for an Digital Healcare Company based in London.
The test had two part : creation of a validated form and a creative part I stored in this other repo. https://github.com/artitudinale1/techtestcreative 


Using either XHTML or HTML5, produce the markup for a simple contact form with client side validation. Use Javascript and any supporting libraries or plugins to help you.

The form must include the following fields:  First Name, Surname, Email Address, Gender Male / Female (Radio Buttons), a subject picker (select list), a message field, a disclaimer checkbox and a submit button. You must make all fields compulsory and ensure that the e-mail address is correctly formatted. If all validation is approved, once submitted, the form must disappear and be replaced with the submitted data in the style of: First Name: <first name>, etc etc.  

-- Please note that this form data does not need to be processed anywhere server side. --
